I am teaching web development in my sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Inline & Block Elements in HTML","number":"8","start":192.0,"end":194.0,"text":" The block element is the inline element."},{"title":"Forms and input tags in HTML","number":"7","start":374.72,"end":376.72,"text":" What are the inner and inner block elements?"},{"title":"Inline & Block Elements in HTML","number":"8","start":382.0,"end":384.0,"text":" Here, the list of the block elements."},{"title":"Inline & Block Elements in HTML","number":"8","start":71.0,"end":74.0,"text":" I will write here the illine and block elements."},{"title":"Your First HTML Website","number":"2","start":1332.64,"end":1336.64,"text":" But now in this course, I will tell you about all the elements."}]
----------------------------------

"where is Comprehensive list for Inline and Block Elements is taught in this lecture?"
User asked this question realted to the video chunks, you have answer in a human way(don't mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is tought in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user ask unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
